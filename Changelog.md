## 2.0.0
2019-01-09
 - Compatibility with SilverStripe 4. If you are using SS3, use the release line 1.x of this module.
 - No other changes, so the module *should* work just like the version 1.0.1 on SilverStripe 3.

## 1.0.1
2019-01-08
 - Fix #6: The 'Custom content' checkbox was not checked initially even if the Content field had a value
 - Fix #5: Added some missing Finnish translations and fixed a few that already existed but didn't work.
 - #3: Try to fix custom JavaScript on Windows server environments. Not sure if it got fixed, as I'm not able to test.
 - Fix #2: Checking the 'Custom content' checkbox made the editor think that something had been changed
 - Created Changelog.md
